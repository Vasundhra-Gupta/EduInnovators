# SIH_CHATBOT
This project was developed for the Smart India Hackathon, where we created an AI-powered chatbot for the Department of Justice website. Aims to improve user experience by providing quick access to legal information and services. It includes interactive features such as voice-based responses and real-time answers to users' questions .
